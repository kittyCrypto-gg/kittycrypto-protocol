# KittyCrypto (KTC) – Whitepaper v0.1

**KittyCrypto (KTC)** is a next-generation, decentralised blockchain protocol written entirely in **TypeScript**, designed to deliver cryptographic security without the unnecessary computational burden of traditional proof-of-work chains. Built for scalability, transparency, and developer inclusivity, KittyCrypto is as accessible to hobbyists as it is powerful for professionals.

*CODE IS LAW*

## Overview

- **Ticker**: KTC  
- **Max Supply**: 100,000,000,000 KTC (fully pre-minted)  
- **Architecture**: Decentralised P2P blockchain  
- **Written in**: TypeScript (ts-node)  
- **Consensus**: Lightweight verification protocol (GPU-optimised)  
- **Block Size**: 10 transactions per block  
- **Block Rule**: A block only forms when it contains 10 fully verified transactions  
- **Transaction Fee**: Zero tax — verifiers are paid directly from the Issuer Wallet

## Reward System

### 1. **Verifier Rewards (Proof of Verification)**

Anyone running a Kitty node can earn KTC by **verifying transactions**.

- Every transaction must be **verified by peers** before inclusion in a block.
- Verification uses **cryptographic challenges** that require effort (manageable by a GPU like a GTX 1080 Ti) but are not prohibitively expensive.
- Once 10 transactions are verified, a block is sealed.
- Each block rewards its verifiers in KTC.
- **No mining pools**, **no ASICs** — anyone with a consumer-grade GPU can participate.

> In the quiet hum of GPUs, a chorus of trust forms — no one alone, each verifier a link in a radiant chain.

### 2. **Developer Contribution Rewards**

Every accepted contribution to the project earns:

### **100 KTC per Contribution Unit (CU)**

- **1 CU** = 1 merged pull request (code, test, documentation)
- Contributions are recorded transparently **on-chain**
- Developers register through a dedicated smart contract (DApp in development)
- The Issuer Wallet automatically distributes rewards upon validation

> Code with us, and the blockchain will pay you directly — not in applause, but in the language of permanence.

Within our repositories, stories are written not only in TypeScript, but in the quiet solidarity of those who know the beauty of creating together, often late at night, often side by side — hands almost touching, laughter blooming over coffee and keystrokes.

## Crowdsale – Initial Distribution for Investors

To fund development and bootstrap liquidity, an initial **crowdsale** will be offered.

- **Initial Price**: 1 KTC = 1/1000 ETC (Ethereum Classic)
- **Backed** 1:1 by the founder’s personal ETC holdings
- After the crowdsale, KTC will **float freely** based on supply and demand

> This is not an ICO. It is a **community-aligned launch** with transparent supply, decentralised rewards, and verifiable scarcity — for those who believe a ledger can carry more than just numbers.

## Why KittyCrypto?

- **No expensive mining hardware required**
- **Transparent reward system** for both builders and verifiers
- **Immutable, cryptographically secure** transaction system
- **Open, decentralised peer-to-peer architecture**
- **Written from scratch in TypeScript** for accessibility and auditability

In its name, KittyCrypto carries softness — but beneath the fur lies a lean and fearless protocol, proud and self-determined.

## Get Involved

KittyCrypto is now forming its **core community**. We are looking for:

- TypeScript developers  
- GPU-savvy engineers  
- Cryptography nerds  
- Open-source contributors  
- Blockchain idealists

> Some come for the code, some for the philosophy — and some, perhaps, for the quiet dream of building something honest, side by side, beneath the shared moonlight of our machines.
